        Before proceeding with any payment, we highly recommend verifying the UPI ID by sending a small amount (â‚¹1) to
        the provided UPI ID. This ensures that the UPI ID is correct and functional.

      <p>
        ZapBill does not validate or verify the UPI IDs. The user is solely responsible for ensuring the correctness of
        the UPI ID they enter. Please double-check the details before making any large payments.
